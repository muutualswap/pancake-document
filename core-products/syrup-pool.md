# xBGSP Pool ( Big Pool )

**Imagine:**

1. You STAKE your BGSP to get xBGSP
2. Now you are earning a portion of 25% of each block reward
3. Now you stake that xBGSP and start earning tokens from brand new BSC projects

This is galaxy mega brain BGSP compounding.

Your BGSP is now pulling in **multiple** income streams.

Sounds‚Ä¶ ‚Äúsweet‚Äù, right? üòè

**xBGSP Pool: where sweet, new tokens meet the BigSwap community!**

xBGSP Pool allows Binance Smart Chain projects to bootstrap adoption by distributing a portion of their tokens to xBGSP token holders.

xBGSP Pool will be split into two sections: Core and Community.

* Core will be initially selected by the BigSwap team.
* Community will be projects that pass a community vote on the governance portal.

Note that any project will be able to distribute tokens via xBGSP Pool but only projects that win a vote would be listed on the swap interface as a default option \(in order to discourage scams\).

**Why would projects want to participate?**

Since PancakeSwap has had the [fairest launch ever](https://medium.com/@pancakeswap/the-fairest-launch-ever-5b246644ba2a), xBGSP Pool projects will allow projects to receive market attention by issuing tokens to the largest \(and most active\) BSC community.

Projects will also receive an immediate default listing on the BigSwap interface, obtaining priority promotion on the exchange \(by ranking temporarily first in selecting tokens on the website\).

**Extending the utility of xBGSP tokens**

Governance, collecting fees, stacking BGSP block rewards and the \(upcoming\) Golden xBGSP lottery are some of the XBGSP token‚Äôs core utility functions‚Ä¶ for now.

With xBGSP Pool, a new function has been offered for xBGSP holders in BigSwap: adding the toppings to $xBGSP and the $BGSP.
